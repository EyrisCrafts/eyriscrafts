This is just how my macos is setup, hope find something useful for yourself :)

#### 1. <a href="https://github.com/exelban/stats">Stats</a>

Open source application that shows Network usage / CPU usage / Fan control / Temperature

#### 2. <a href="https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake">KeepingYouAwake</a>

Ever wanted to stop mac from going to sleep? Maybe when you want to download something. Then this is quite useful.

#### 3. Smooth backspace

Macos by default has a quite annoyingly laggy backspacing. Change your keyboard settings to this and get a better experience deleting text.

#### 4. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm">Browser extension - ublock origin</a>

<img src="/chrome-extensions/ublock.png" alt="UblockOrigin">

Ever felt that your adblocker misses ads? A lot of the ad blockers have made agreements with ad companies to let their ads through in exchange for money. 
Use Ublock Origin for the best adblock experience


#### 5. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo">Browser extension - Tamper Monkey</a>

If you have never used temper monkey, you have missed out on a whole new way of surfing the internet.
